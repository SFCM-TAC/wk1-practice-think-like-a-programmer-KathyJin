    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
  <ul>
  <li>
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      Finding the MIDI value of the pitch, and multiply the value by however you want the pitch value to be.

    </div>
    <div class="question">
     <ul>
    <li>
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
       </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      I'd like to clarify the type of the instrument, such as ukelele. Then, I will indicate the type of sounds I want to be on there. I will then pick the duration of the sound by entering the value of time.
